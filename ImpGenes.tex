\begin{itemize}
	\item Background reading / scholarship / thinking / predictions.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What has been done since McVean and Hurst?
		\item What are the predictions? 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $d_N/d_s$ 
			\item selective sweeps? 
			\item background selection? 
			\item clustering?  
			\item maternal/zygotic interactions
			\item recombination rate [sex differences in  as well]
		\end{itemize}
		\item What are the data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item imprinting status
			\item comparative genetics [draft genomes from a bunch of mammals]
			\item population genetics [whole genome re-sequencing --- e.g. thousand genomes project]
		\end{itemize}
		\item Where are the data
		\item Analysis pipeline
