	Abstract = {Imprinting describes the differential expression of alleles based on their parent of origin. Deep sequencing of RNAs from maize (Zea mays) endosperm and embryo tissue 14 d after pollination was used to identify imprinted genes among a set of ~12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms between the B73 and Mo17 genotypes. The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm, including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted, while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes. A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes. The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested. Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns. The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.},

	Abstract = {Conflicting evolutionary interests between mother and offspring are hypothesized to drive an evolutionary arms race during mammalian pregnancy, and thus, positive selection may cause the rapid divergence of placental proteins that affect maternal or fetal fitness. We investigated the genomic consequences of placental expression in rodents and report that a substantial proportion (20.5%) of genes specifically expressed in the mature placenta are rapidly evolving. Moreover, we found that most rapidly evolving genes belong to just three pregnancy-related gene families: placental cathepsins, prolactins, and placental carcinoembryonic antigens. We then sequenced the most rapidly evolving gene, trophoblast-specific protein alpha (Tpbpa), in nine different Mus species/subspecies and found evidence of positive selection within the Mus lineage, with an excess of nonsynonymous changes clustering near a functionally important interaction site. Together, these results suggest that placental proteins, which mediate interactions between mother and offspring, often may be the targets of evolutionary conflict.},

@article{Hutter2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In contrast to the majority of mammalian genes, imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed with the choice of the active allele depending on its parental origin. Due to their special inheritance patterns, maternally and paternally expressed genes might be under different evolutionary pressure. Here, we aimed at assessing the evolutionary history of imprinted genes.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the conservation of imprinted genes in vertebrate genomes and their exposition to natural selection. In a genome-wide comparison, orthologs of imprinted genes show a stronger divergence on cDNA and protein level in mammals. This pattern is most pronounced for maternally expressed genes in rodents in comparison to their non-rodent orthologs. The divergence is not attributable to increased mutation of CpG positions. It is contrasted by strong conservation of paternally expressed genes in mouse and rat. Interestingly, we found that the early divergence of imprinted genes was accompanied by an unusually strict conservation of their paralogs.
CONCLUSIONS: The apparent degeneration of maternally expressed genes may reflect a relaxation of selective pressure due to counteracting effects on maternal and embryonic fitness. Functional redundancy provided by the presence of highly conserved (non-imprinted) paralogs may have facilitated the divergence. Moreover, intensification of imprinting in modern rodents seems to have shifted the evolutionary fate of imprinted genes towards strong purifying selection.},

@article{Williamson2004,
	Abstract = {We develop a Poisson random-field model of polymorphism and divergence that allows arbitrary dominance relations in a diploid context. This model provides a maximum-likelihood framework for estimating both selection and dominance parameters of new mutations using information on the frequency spectrum of sequence polymorphisms. This is the first DNA sequence-based estimator of the dominance parameter. Our model also leads to a likelihood-ratio test for distinguishing nongenic from genic selection; simulations indicate that this test is quite powerful when a large number of segregating sites are available. We also use simulations to explore the bias in selection parameter estimates caused by unacknowledged dominance relations. When inference is based on the frequency spectrum of polymorphisms, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter can be very strongly biased even for minor deviations from the genic selection model. Surprisingly, however, when inference is based on polymorphism and divergence (McDonald-Kreitman) data, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter are nearly unbiased, even for completely dominant or recessive mutations. Further, we find that weak overdominant selection can increase, rather than decrease, the substitution rate relative to levels of polymorphism. This nonintuitive result has major implications for the interpretation of several popular tests of neutrality.},

@article{McVean1997,
	Abstract = {Genomically imprinted genes are those for which expression is dependent on the sex of the parent from which they are derived. Numerous theories have been proposed for the evolution of genomic imprinting: one theory is that it is an intra-individual manifestation of classical parent -offspring conflict. This theory is unique in predicting that an arms race may develop between maternally and paternally derived genes for the control of foetal growth demands. Such antagonistic coevolution may be mediated through changes in the structure of the proteins concerned. Comparable coevolution is the most likely explanation for the rapid changes seen in antigenic components of parasites and antigen recognition components of immune systems. We have examined the evolution of insulin-like growth factor Igf2, and its antagonistic receptor Igf2r) and find that in contrast to immune genes, at the sites of mutual binding they are highly conserved. In addition, we have analysed the rate of molecular evolution of seven imprinted genes including Igf2 and Igf2r), sequenced in both mouse and rat, and had that this is the same as that of nonimprinted receptors and significantly lower than that of immune genes controlling for differences in mutation rates. Contrary to the expectations of the conflict hypothesis, we hence find no evidence for antagonistic coevolution of imprinted genes mediated by changes in sequence.},

@article{Smith1998,
	Abstract = {The repeatability of patterns of variation in Ka/Ks and Ks is expected if such patterns are the result of deterministic forces. We have contrasted the molecular evolution of the mammalian insulin-like growth factor type II receptor (Igf2r) in the mouse-rat comparison with that in the human-cow comparison. In so doing, we investigate explanations for both the evolution of genomic imprinting and for Ks variation (and hence putatively for mutation rate evolution). Previous analysis of Igf2r, in the mouse-rat comparison, found Ka/Ks patterns that were suggested to be contrary to those expected under the conflict theory of imprinting. We find that Ka/Ks variation is repeatable and hence confirm these patterns. However, we also find that the molecular evolution of Igf2r signal sequences suggests that positive selection, and hence conflict, may be affecting this region. The variation in Ks across Igf2r is also repeatable. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of such repeatability. We consider three explanations for the variation in Ks across the gene: (1) that it is the result of mutational biases, (2) that it is the result of selection on the mutation rate, and (3) that it is the product of selection on codon usage. Explanations 2 and 3 predict a Ka-Ks correlation, which is not found. Explanation 3 also predicts a negative correlation between codon bias and Ks, which is also not found. However, in support of explanation 1 we do find that in rodents the rate of silent C --> T mutations at CpG sites does covary with Ks, suggesting that methylation-induced mutational patterns can explain some of the variation in Ks. We find evidence to suggest that this CpG effect is due to both variation in CpG density, and to variation in the frequency with which CpGs mutate. Interestingly, however, a GC4 analysis shows no covariance with Ks, suggesting that to eliminate methyl-associated effects CpG rates themselves must be analyzed. These results suggest that, in contrast to previous studies of intragenic variation, Ks patterns are not simply caused by the same forces responsible for Ka/Ks correlations.},
