	Abstract = {Summary
1. Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a population is known.2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research.3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations.4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models.5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions.},

@article{Yang2014,
	Abstract = {Mixed linear models are emerging as a method of choice for conducting genetic association studies in humans and other organisms. The advantages of the mixed-linear-model association ({MLMA)} method include the prevention of false positive associations due to population or relatedness structure and an increase in power obtained through the application of a correction that is specific to this structure. An underappreciated point is that {MLMA} can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard {MLMA} approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying {MLMA} methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that {MLMA} methods are still subject to potential pitfalls. Here we describe and quantify the advantages and pitfalls of {MLMA} methods as a function of study design and provide recommendations for the application of these methods in practical settings.

	Abstract = {Author {SummaryThe} goal of polygenic modeling is to better understand the relationship between genetic variation and variation in observed characteristics, including variation in quantitative traits (e.g. cholesterol level in humans, milk production in cattle) and disease susceptibility. Improvements in polygenic modeling will help improve our understanding of this relationship and could ultimately lead to, for example, changes in clinical practice in humans or better breeding/mating strategies in agricultural programs. Polygenic models present important challenges, both at the modeling/statistical level (what modeling assumptions produce the best results) and at the computational level (how should these models be effectively fit to data). We develop novel approaches to help tackle both these challenges, and we demonstrate the gains in accuracy that result in both simulated and real data examples.},

@article{Lawson2013,
	Abstract = {Parent-of-origin effects occur when the phenotypic effect of an allele depends on whether it is inherited from the mother or the father. Several phenomena can cause parent-of-origin effects, but the best characterized is parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression associated with genomic imprinting. The development of new mapping approaches applied to the growing abundance of genomic data has demonstrated that imprinted genes can be important contributors to complex trait variation. Therefore, to understand the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits, including complex diseases and traits of agricultural importance, it is crucial to account for these parent-of-origin effects. Here, we discuss patterns of phenotypic variation associated with imprinting, evidence supporting its role in complex trait variation and approaches for identifying its molecular signatures.

	Abstract = {Author {SummaryPhenotype} is a function of a genome and its environment. Heritability is the fraction of variation in a phenotype determined by genetic factors in a population. Current methods to estimate heritability rely on the phenotypic correlations of closely related individuals and are potentially upwardly biased, due to the impact of epistasis and shared environment. We develop new methods to estimate heritability over both closely and distantly related individuals. By examining the phenotypic correlation among different types of related individuals such as siblings, half-siblings, and first cousins, we show that shared environment is the primary determinant of inflated estimates of heritability. For a large number of phenotypes, it is not known how much of the heritability is explained by {SNPs} included on current genotyping platforms. Existing methods to estimate this component of heritability are biased in the presence of related individuals. We develop a method that permits the inclusion of both closely and distantly related individuals when estimating heritability explained by genotyped {SNPs} and use it to make estimates for 23 medically relevant phenotypes. These estimates can be used to increase our understanding of the distribution and frequency of functionally relevant variants and thereby inform the design of future studies.},

	Abstract = {Understanding genetic variation of complex traits in human populations has moved from the quantification of the resemblance between close relatives to the dissection of genetic variation into the contributions of individual genomic loci. However, major questions remain unanswered: How much phenotypic variation is genetic; how much of the genetic variation is additive and can be explained by fitting all genetic variants simultaneously in one model, and what is the joint distribution of effect size and allele frequency at causal variants? We review and compare three whole-genome analysis methods that use mixed linear models ({MLMs)} to estimate genetic variation. In all methods, genetic variation is estimated from the relationship between close or distant relatives on the basis of pedigree information and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs).} We discuss theory, estimation procedures, bias, and precision of each method and review recent advances in the dissection of genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. By using genome-wide data, it is now established that {SNPs} in total account for far more of the genetic variation than the statistically highly significant {SNPs} that have been detected in genome-wide association studies. All {SNPs} together, however, do not account for all of the genetic variance estimated by pedigree-based methods. We explain possible reasons for this remaining ``missing heritability.''},

	Abstract = {To the Editor:
The use of linear mixed models ({LMMs)} in genome-wide association studies ({GWAS)} is now widely accepted because {LMMs} have been shown to be capable of correcting for several forms of confounding due to genetic relatedness, such as population structure and familial relatedness, and because recent advances have made them computationally efficient. {LMMs} tackle confounding by using a matrix of pairwise genetic similarities to model the relatedness among subjects. The consensus until now has been that all available single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)} should be used to determine these similarities. Here, however, we show theoretically and experimentally that carefully selecting a small number of {SNPs} systematically increases power (that is, it jointly reduces false positives and false negatives), improves calibration (lessens inflation or deflation of the test statistic) and reduces computational cost.

	Abstract = {Linear mixed models have attracted considerable attention recently as a powerful and effective tool for accounting for population stratification and relatedness in genetic association tests. However, existing methods for exact computation of standard test statistics are computationally impractical for even moderate-sized genome-wide association studies. To address this issue, several approximate methods have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient exact method, which we refer to as genome-wide efficient mixed-model association ({GEMMA)}, that makes approximations unnecessary in many contexts. This method is approximately n times faster than the widely used exact method known as efficient mixed-model association ({EMMA)}, where n is the sample size, making exact genome-wide association analysis computationally practical for large numbers of individuals.

	Abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, {SNPs} identified by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS)} explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis ({GCTA)}, which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the “missing heritability” problem. {GCTA} estimates the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular {SNP} to the trait. We introduce {GCTA's} five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from {SNPs}, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the {SNPs}, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and {GWAS} simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The {GCTA} software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large {GWAS} data sets.},

	Abstract = {Mixed linear model ({MLM)} methods have proven useful in controlling for population structure and relatedness within genome-wide association studies. However, {MLM-based} methods can be computationally challenging for large datasets. We report a compression approach, called 'compressed {MLM'}, that decreases the effective sample size of such datasets by clustering individuals into groups. We also present a complementary approach, 'population parameters previously determined' ({P3D)}, that eliminates the need to re-compute variance components. We applied these two methods both independently and combined in selected genetic association datasets from human, dog and maize. The joint implementation of these two methods markedly reduced computing time and either maintained or improved statistical power. We used simulations to demonstrate the usefulness in controlling for substructure in genetic association datasets for a range of species and genetic architectures. We have made these methods available within an implementation of the software program {TASSEL.}},

@article{Kang2010,
	Abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies ({GWASs)} have identified numerous loci associated with complex traits, imprecise modeling of the genetic relatedness within study samples may cause substantial inflation of test statistics and possibly spurious associations. Variance component approaches, such as efficient mixed-model association ({EMMA)}, can correct for a wide range of sample structures by explicitly accounting for pairwise relatedness between individuals, using high-density markers to model the phenotype distribution; but such approaches are computationally impractical. We report here a variance component approach implemented in publicly available software, {EMMA} {eXpedited} ({EMMAX)}, that reduces the computational time for analyzing large {GWAS} data sets from years to hours. We apply this method to two human {GWAS} data sets, performing association analysis for ten quantitative traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort and seven common diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We find that {EMMAX} outperforms both principal component analysis and genomic control in correcting for sample structure.},

@article{Kong2009,
	Abstract = {Effects of susceptibility variants may depend on from which parent they are inherited. Although many associations between sequence variants and human traits have been discovered through genome-wide associations, the impact of parental origin has largely been ignored. Here we show that for 38,167 Icelanders genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} chips, the parental origin of most alleles can be determined. For this we used a combination of genealogy and long-range phasing. We then focused on {SNPs} that associate with diseases and are within 500 kilobases of known imprinted genes. Seven independent {SNP} associations were examined. Five—one with breast cancer, one with basal-cell carcinoma and three with type 2 diabetes—have parental-origin-specific associations. These variants are located in two genomic regions, 11p15 and 7q32, each harbouring a cluster of imprinted genes. Furthermore, we observed a novel association between the {SNP} rs2334499 at 11p15 and type 2 diabetes. Here the allele that confers risk when paternally inherited is protective when maternally transmitted. We identified a differentially methylated {CTCF-binding} site at 11p15 and demonstrated correlation of rs2334499 with decreased methylation of that site.},

	Abstract = {Epigenetic effects attributed to genomic imprinting are increasingly recognized as an important source of variation in quantitative traits. However, little is known about their relative contribution to phenotypic variation compared to those of additive and dominance effects, and almost nothing about their role in phenotypic evolution. Here we address these questions by investigating the relative contribution of additive, dominance, and imprinting effects of quantitative trait loci ({QTL)} to variation in “early” and “late” body weight in an intercross of mice selected for divergent adult body weight. We identified 18 loci on 13 chromosomes; additive effects accounted for most of the phenotypic variation throughout development, and imprinting effects were always small. Genetic effects on early weight showed more dominance, less additive, and, surprisingly, less imprinting variation than that of late weight. The predominance of additivity of {QTL} effects on body weight follows the expectation that additive effects account for the evolutionary divergence between selection lines. We hypothesize that the appearance of more imprinting effects on late body weight may be a consequence of divergent selection on adult body weight, which may have indirectly selected for alleles showing partial imprinting effects due to their associated additive effects, highlighting a potential role of genomic imprinting in the response to selection.},

	Abstract = {Standard Mendelian genetic processes incorporate several symmetries, one of which is that the level of expression of a gene inherited from an organism's mother is identical to the level should that gene have been inherited paternally. For a small number of loci in a variety of taxa, this symmetry does not hold; such genes are said to be "genomically imprinted" (or simply "imprinted"). The best known examples of imprinted loci come from mammals and angiosperms, although there are also cases from several insects and some data suggesting that imprinting exists in zebra fish. Imprinting means that reciprocal heterozygotes need not be, on average, phenotypically identical. When this difference is incorporated into the standard quantitative-genetic model for two alleles at a single locus, a number of standard expressions are altered in fundamental ways. Most importantly, in contrast to the case with euMendelian expression, the additive and dominance deviations are correlated. It would clearly be of interest to be able to separate imprinting effects from maternal genetic effects, but when the latter are added to the model, the well-known generalized least-squares approach to deriving breeding values cannot be applied. Distinguishing these two types of parent-of-origin effects is not a simple problem and requires further research.},

@article{Wolf2009b,
	Abstract = {Genomic imprinting, where the effects of alleles depend on their parent-of-origin, can be an important component of the genetic architecture of complex traits. Although there has been a rapidly increasing number of studies of genetic architecture that have examined imprinting effects, none have examined whether imprinting effects depend on genetic background. Such effects are critical for the evolution of genomic imprinting because they allow the imprinting state of a locus to evolve as a function of genetic background. Here we develop a two-locus model of epistasis that includes epistatic interactions involving imprinting effects and apply this model to scan the mouse genome for loci that modulate the imprinting effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL). The inclusion of imprinting leads to nine orthogonal forms of epistasis, five of which do not appear in the usual two-locus decomposition of epistasis. Each form represents a change in the imprinting status of one locus across different classes of genotypes at the other locus. Our genome scan identified two different locus pairs that show complex patterns of epistasis, where the imprinting effect at one locus changes across genetic backgrounds at the other locus. Thus, our model provides a framework for the detection of genetic background-dependent imprinting effects that should provide insights into the background dependence and evolution of genomic imprinting. Our application of the model to a genome scan supports this assertion by identifying pairs of loci that show reciprocal changes in their imprinting status as the background provided by the other locus changes.},

	Abstract = {Genomic imprinting refers to the pattern of monoallelic parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression where one of the two alleles at a locus is expressed and the other silenced. Although some genes in mice are known to be imprinted, the true scope of imprinting and its impact on the genetic architecture of a wide range of morphometric traits is mostly unknown. We therefore searched for quantitative trait loci ({QTL)} exhibiting imprinting effects on mandible size and shape traits in a large F3 population of mice originating from an intercross of the {LG/J} (Large) and {SM/J} (Small) inbred strains. We discovered a total of 51 {QTL} affecting mandible size and shape, 6 of which exhibited differences between reciprocal heterozygotes, the usual signature of imprinting effects. However, our analysis showed that only one of these {QTL} (affecting mandible size) exhibited a pattern consistent with true imprinting effects, whereas reciprocal heterozygote differences in the other five all were due to maternal genetic effects. We concluded that genomic imprinting has a negligible effect on these specific morphometric traits, and that maternal genetic effects may account for many of the previously reported instances of apparent genomic imprinting.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic source of variation in quantitative traits that results from monoallelic gene expression, where commonly either only the paternally- or the maternally-derived allele is expressed. Imprinting has been shown to affect a diversity of complex traits in a variety of species. For several such quantitative traits sex-dependent genetic effects have been discovered, but whether imprinting effects also show such sex-dependence has yet to be explored. Moreover, theoretical work on the evolution of sex-dependent genomic imprinting effects makes specific predictions about the phenotypic patterns of such effects, which, however, have not been assessed empirically to date. RESULTS: Using a genome-scan for loci affecting a set of complex growth and body composition traits from an intercross between two divergent mouse strains, we investigated possible sex-dependent imprinting effects. Our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of genomic imprinting effects that depend on sex and are not related to sex-chromosome effects. We detected a total of 13 loci on 11 chromosomes that showed significant differences between the sexes in imprinting effects. Most loci showed imprinting effects in only one sex, with eight imprinted effects found in males and six in females. One locus showed sex-dependent imprinting effects in both sexes for different traits. The absence of an imprinting effect in one sex was not necessarily indicative of the overall inactivity of the locus in that sex, as for several loci a significant additive or dominance effect was detected. Moreover, three loci exhibited significant additive effects in both sexes but their imprinting effect was restricted to one sex. CONCLUSION: Our results clearly show that imprinting effects can be sex-dependent and also suggest that new candidate imprinted loci can be detected when taking account of sex-specific imprinting effects. However, predictions made about the evolution of sex-dependent imprinting effects and associated phenotypic patterns cannot be unequivocally supported at present and further research into the selection pressures applied to the strains of mice used in our study is required.},

	Abstract = {Parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression resulting from genomic imprinting plays an important role in modulating complex traits ranging from developmental processes to cognitive abilities and associated disorders. However, while gene-targeting techniques have allowed for the identification of imprinted loci, very little is known about the contribution of imprinting to quantitative variation in complex traits. Most studies, furthermore, assume a simple pattern of imprinting, resulting in either paternal or maternal gene expression; yet, more complex patterns of effects also exist. As a result, the distribution and number of different imprinting patterns across the genome remain largely unexplored. We address these unresolved issues using a genome-wide scan for imprinted quantitative trait loci (iQTL) affecting body weight and growth in mice using a novel three-generation design. We identified ten iQTL that display much more complex and diverse effect patterns than previously assumed, including four loci with effects similar to the callipyge mutation found in sheep. Three loci display a new phenotypic pattern that we refer to as bipolar dominance, where the two heterozygotes are different from each other while the two homozygotes are identical to each other. Our study furthermore detected a paternally expressed iQTL on Chromosome 7 in a region containing a known imprinting cluster with many paternally expressed genes. Surprisingly, the effects of the iQTL were mostly restricted to traits expressed after weaning. Our results imply that the quantitative effects of an imprinted allele at a locus depend both on its parent of origin and the allele it is paired with. Our findings also show that the imprinting pattern of a locus can be variable over ontogenetic time and, in contrast to current views, may often be stronger at later stages in life.},

@article{Hager2008,
	Abstract = {Epigenetic effects are increasingly recognized as an important source of variation in complex traits and have emerged as the focus of a rapidly expanding area of research. Principle among these effects is genomic imprinting, which has generally been examined in analyses of complex traits by testing for parent-of-origin-dependent effects of alleles. However, in most of these analyses maternal effects are confounded with genomic imprinting because they can produce the same patterns of phenotypic variation expected for various forms of imprinting. Distinguishing between the two is critical for genetic and evolutionary studies because they have entirely different patterns of gene expression and evolutionary dynamics. Using a simple single-locus model, we show that maternal genetic effects can result in patterns that mimic those expected under genomic imprinting. We further demonstrate how maternal effects and imprinting effects can be distinguished using genomic data from parents and offspring. The model results are applied to a genome scan for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting growth- and weight-related traits in mice to illustrate how maternal effects can mimic imprinting. This genome scan revealed five separate maternal-effect loci that caused a diversity of patterns mimicking those expected under various modes of genomic imprinting. These results demonstrate that the appearance of parent-of-origin-dependent effects (POEs) of alleles at a locus cannot be taken as direct evidence that the locus is imprinted. Moreover, they show that, in gene mapping studies, genetic data from both parents and offspring are required to successfully differentiate between imprinting and maternal effects as the cause of apparent parent-of-origin effects of alleles.},

@article{Cheverud2008,
	Abstract = {Genomic imprinting results in the differential expression of genes, depending on which allele is inherited from the mother and which from the father. The effects of such differential gene expression are reflected in phenotypic differences between the reciprocal heterozygotes (Aa vs. aA). Although many imprinted genes have been identified and play a key role in development, little is known about the contribution of imprinting to quantitative variation in trait expression. Here, we examine this problem by mapping imprinting effects on adult body composition traits in the F(3) generation of an intercross between the Large (LG/J) and Small (SM/J) inbred mouse strains. We identified eight pleiotropic imprinted quantitative trait loci (iQTL) located throughout the genome. Most iQTL are in novel locations that have not previously been associated with imprinting effects, but those on chromosomes 7, 12, and centromeric 18 lie in regions previously identified as containing imprinted genes. Our results show that the effects of genomic imprinting are relatively small, with reciprocal heterozygotes differing by approximately 0.25 standard deviation units and the effects at each locus accounting for 1% to 4% of the phenotypic variance. We detected a variety of imprinting patterns, with paternal expression being the most common. These results indicate that genomic imprinting has small, but detectable, effects on the normal variation of complex traits in adults and is likely to be more common than usually thought.},

@article{Visscher2006,
	Abstract = {The study of continuously varying, quantitative traits is important in evolutionary biology, agriculture, and medicine. Variation in such traits is attributable to many, possibly interacting, genes whose expression may be sensitive to the environment, which makes their dissection into underlying causative factors difficult. An important population parameter for quantitative traits is heritability, the proportion of total variance that is due to genetic factors. Response to artificial and natural selection and the degree of resemblance between relatives are all a function of this parameter. Following the classic paper by R. A. Fisher in 1918, the estimation of additive and dominance genetic variance and heritability in populations is based upon the expected proportion of genes shared between different types of relatives, and explicit, often controversial and untestable models of genetic and non-genetic causes of family resemblance. With genome-wide coverage of genetic markers it is now possible to estimate such parameters solely within families using the actual degree of identity-by-descent sharing between relatives. Using genome scans on 4,401 quasi-independent sib pairs of which 3,375 pairs had phenotypes, we estimated the heritability of height from empirical genome-wide identity-by-descent sharing, which varied from 0.374 to 0.617 (mean 0.498, standard deviation 0.036). The variance in identity-by-descent sharing per chromosome and per genome was consistent with theory. The maximum likelihood estimate of the heritability for height was 0.80 with no evidence for non-genetic causes of sib resemblance, consistent with results from independent twin and family studies but using an entirely separate source of information. Our application shows that it is feasible to estimate genetic variance solely from within-family segregation and provides an independent validation of previously untestable assumptions. Given sufficient data, our new paradigm will allow the estimation of genetic variation for disease susceptibility and quantitative traits that is free from confounding with non-genetic factors and will allow partitioning of genetic variation into additive and non-additive components.},

	Abstract = {The expression of an imprinted gene is dependent on the sex of the parent it was inherited from, and as a result reciprocal heterozygotes may display different phenotypes. In contrast, maternal genetic terms arise when the phenotype of an offspring is influenced by the phenotype of its mother beyond the direct inheritance of alleles. Both maternal effects and imprinting may contribute to resemblance between offspring of the same mother. We demonstrate that two standard quantitative genetic models for deriving breeding values, population variances and covariances between relatives, are not equivalent when maternal genetic effects and imprinting are acting. Maternal and imprinting effects introduce both sex-dependent and generation-dependent effects that result in differences in the way additive and dominance effects are defined for the two approaches. We use a simple example to demonstrate that both imprinting and maternal genetic effects add extra terms to covariances between relatives and that model misspecification may over- or underestimate true covariances or lead to extremely variable parameter estimation. Thus, an understanding of various forms of parental effects is essential in correctly estimating quantitative genetic variance components.},

	Abstract = {Parent-of-origin effects were mapped by multimarker regression analysis in a cross between a high body weight selected line ({DU6)} and a control line ({DUKs).} The difference between F2 progeny being heterozygous Qq and {qQ} (first allele is paternally derived) for grandpaternal Q and grandmaternal q alleles was genome-wide significant for the traits liver weight and spleen weight with a paternal imprinting effect at 1 {cM} on proximal chromosome 11. Suggestive imprinting effects (chromosome-wide error probability less than 0.05) were found for the traits body weight, liver weight, and kidney weight, and were located on chromosome 14 at 25 {cM}, 23 {cM}, and 32 {cM}, respectively. A genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus ({QTL)} for spleen weight at 26 {cM} slightly failed the suggestive significance level for imprinting. The effect was consistently maternal for all these traits on chromosome 14. Further suggestive imprinting effects were found for abdominal fat percentage on chromosome 3, for spleen weight on chromosome 5, and for liver weight on chromosome X. Our results are supported by a likely imprinting in a human genome region with homology to mouse chromosome 14 and agree well with the known imprinting of proximal chromosome 11 in the mouse.},

	Abstract = {Standard genetic analyses assume that reciprocal heterozygotes are, on average, phenotypically identical. If a locus is subject to genomic imprinting, however, this assumption does not hold. We incorporate imprinting into the standard quantitative-genetic model for two alleles at a single locus, deriving expressions for the additive and dominance components of genetic variance, as well as measures of resemblance among relatives. We show that, in contrast to the case with Mendelian expression, the additive and dominance deviations are correlated. In principle, this correlation allows imprinting to be detected solely on the basis of different measures of familial resemblances, but in practice, the standard error of the estimate is likely to be too large for a test to have much statistical power. The effects of genomic imprinting will need to be incorporated into quantitative-genetic models of many traits, for example, those concerned with mammalian birthweight.},

	Abstract = {A common study design to map quantitative trait loci ({QTL)} is to compare the phenotypes and marker genotypes of two or more siblings in a sample of unrelated sib groups, and to test for linkage between chromosome location and quantitative trait values. The simplest case is sib pairs only, in particular dizygotic twin pairs, and a simple and elegant regression method was proposed by Haseman \& Elston in 1972 to test for linkage. Since then, several other methods have been proposed to test for linkage. In this study, we derived the statistical power of linear regression and maximum likelihood methods to map {QTL} from sib pair data analytically, and determined which methods are superior under which set of population parameters. In particular, we considered four regression-based and three maximum likelihood-based approaches, and derived asymptotic approximations of the mean test statistic and statistical power for each method. It was found, both analytically and by computer simulation, that the revisited or new {Haseman–Elston} method (based upon the mean-corrected crossproduct of the observations on sib-pairs) is less powerful than a full maximum likelihood approach and is also inferior to the {Haseman–Elston} method under a realistic range of values for the population parameters. We found that a simple regression method, based upon both the squared difference and the mean-corrected squared sum of the observations on sib-pairs, is as powerful as a full maximum likelihood approach. Our derivations of statistical power for regression and maximum likelihood methods provide a simple way to compare alternative methods and obviate the need to perform elaborate computer simulations. {DZ} twin pairs are likely to be more powerful for linkage analysis than ordinary siblings because they may share more common environmental effects, thereby increasing the proportion of within-family variance that is explained by a {QTL.}},

	Abstract = {abstract: Quantitative genetical theory suggests that characters existing in developmentally or functionally integrated groups are expected to be genetically correlated because they share a common inheritance. The genetic independence model for the cause of this genetic integration predicts that pleiotropic effects of single genes are mostly restricted to the characters in these integrated groups. We tested this model by estimating the additive and dominance effects of quantitative trait loci ({QTLs)} affecting early‐ (cranial vault) and late‐developing (face) skeletal characters in F2 house mice originally derived from a cross of the Large and Small inbred strains. Interval mapping procedures were used that resulted in the identification of 26 {QTLs} on 17 of the 19 autosomes that significantly affected these characters. Additive, but not dominance, genotypic effects of many of these {QTLs} predominantly affected either the cranial vault or face characters, which supports the genetic independence model. Only two {QTLs} had positive pleiotropic effects on one group of characters but negative pleiotropic effects on the other (antagonistic pleiotropy).},

	Abstract = {Imprinting describes the differential expression of alleles based on their parent of origin. Deep sequencing of RNAs from maize (Zea mays) endosperm and embryo tissue 14 d after pollination was used to identify imprinted genes among a set of ~12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms between the B73 and Mo17 genotypes. The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm, including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted, while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes. A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes. The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested. Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns. The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.},

	Abstract = {Conflicting evolutionary interests between mother and offspring are hypothesized to drive an evolutionary arms race during mammalian pregnancy, and thus, positive selection may cause the rapid divergence of placental proteins that affect maternal or fetal fitness. We investigated the genomic consequences of placental expression in rodents and report that a substantial proportion (20.5%) of genes specifically expressed in the mature placenta are rapidly evolving. Moreover, we found that most rapidly evolving genes belong to just three pregnancy-related gene families: placental cathepsins, prolactins, and placental carcinoembryonic antigens. We then sequenced the most rapidly evolving gene, trophoblast-specific protein alpha (Tpbpa), in nine different Mus species/subspecies and found evidence of positive selection within the Mus lineage, with an excess of nonsynonymous changes clustering near a functionally important interaction site. Together, these results suggest that placental proteins, which mediate interactions between mother and offspring, often may be the targets of evolutionary conflict.},

@article{Hutter2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In contrast to the majority of mammalian genes, imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed with the choice of the active allele depending on its parental origin. Due to their special inheritance patterns, maternally and paternally expressed genes might be under different evolutionary pressure. Here, we aimed at assessing the evolutionary history of imprinted genes.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the conservation of imprinted genes in vertebrate genomes and their exposition to natural selection. In a genome-wide comparison, orthologs of imprinted genes show a stronger divergence on cDNA and protein level in mammals. This pattern is most pronounced for maternally expressed genes in rodents in comparison to their non-rodent orthologs. The divergence is not attributable to increased mutation of CpG positions. It is contrasted by strong conservation of paternally expressed genes in mouse and rat. Interestingly, we found that the early divergence of imprinted genes was accompanied by an unusually strict conservation of their paralogs.
CONCLUSIONS: The apparent degeneration of maternally expressed genes may reflect a relaxation of selective pressure due to counteracting effects on maternal and embryonic fitness. Functional redundancy provided by the presence of highly conserved (non-imprinted) paralogs may have facilitated the divergence. Moreover, intensification of imprinting in modern rodents seems to have shifted the evolutionary fate of imprinted genes towards strong purifying selection.},

@article{Williamson2004,
	Abstract = {We develop a Poisson random-field model of polymorphism and divergence that allows arbitrary dominance relations in a diploid context. This model provides a maximum-likelihood framework for estimating both selection and dominance parameters of new mutations using information on the frequency spectrum of sequence polymorphisms. This is the first DNA sequence-based estimator of the dominance parameter. Our model also leads to a likelihood-ratio test for distinguishing nongenic from genic selection; simulations indicate that this test is quite powerful when a large number of segregating sites are available. We also use simulations to explore the bias in selection parameter estimates caused by unacknowledged dominance relations. When inference is based on the frequency spectrum of polymorphisms, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter can be very strongly biased even for minor deviations from the genic selection model. Surprisingly, however, when inference is based on polymorphism and divergence (McDonald-Kreitman) data, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter are nearly unbiased, even for completely dominant or recessive mutations. Further, we find that weak overdominant selection can increase, rather than decrease, the substitution rate relative to levels of polymorphism. This nonintuitive result has major implications for the interpretation of several popular tests of neutrality.},

@article{McVean1997,
	Abstract = {Genomically imprinted genes are those for which expression is dependent on the sex of the parent from which they are derived. Numerous theories have been proposed for the evolution of genomic imprinting: one theory is that it is an intra-individual manifestation of classical parent -offspring conflict. This theory is unique in predicting that an arms race may develop between maternally and paternally derived genes for the control of foetal growth demands. Such antagonistic coevolution may be mediated through changes in the structure of the proteins concerned. Comparable coevolution is the most likely explanation for the rapid changes seen in antigenic components of parasites and antigen recognition components of immune systems. We have examined the evolution of insulin-like growth factor Igf2, and its antagonistic receptor Igf2r) and find that in contrast to immune genes, at the sites of mutual binding they are highly conserved. In addition, we have analysed the rate of molecular evolution of seven imprinted genes including Igf2 and Igf2r), sequenced in both mouse and rat, and had that this is the same as that of nonimprinted receptors and significantly lower than that of immune genes controlling for differences in mutation rates. Contrary to the expectations of the conflict hypothesis, we hence find no evidence for antagonistic coevolution of imprinted genes mediated by changes in sequence.},

@article{Smith1998,
	Abstract = {The repeatability of patterns of variation in Ka/Ks and Ks is expected if such patterns are the result of deterministic forces. We have contrasted the molecular evolution of the mammalian insulin-like growth factor type II receptor (Igf2r) in the mouse-rat comparison with that in the human-cow comparison. In so doing, we investigate explanations for both the evolution of genomic imprinting and for Ks variation (and hence putatively for mutation rate evolution). Previous analysis of Igf2r, in the mouse-rat comparison, found Ka/Ks patterns that were suggested to be contrary to those expected under the conflict theory of imprinting. We find that Ka/Ks variation is repeatable and hence confirm these patterns. However, we also find that the molecular evolution of Igf2r signal sequences suggests that positive selection, and hence conflict, may be affecting this region. The variation in Ks across Igf2r is also repeatable. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of such repeatability. We consider three explanations for the variation in Ks across the gene: (1) that it is the result of mutational biases, (2) that it is the result of selection on the mutation rate, and (3) that it is the product of selection on codon usage. Explanations 2 and 3 predict a Ka-Ks correlation, which is not found. Explanation 3 also predicts a negative correlation between codon bias and Ks, which is also not found. However, in support of explanation 1 we do find that in rodents the rate of silent C --> T mutations at CpG sites does covary with Ks, suggesting that methylation-induced mutational patterns can explain some of the variation in Ks. We find evidence to suggest that this CpG effect is due to both variation in CpG density, and to variation in the frequency with which CpGs mutate. Interestingly, however, a GC4 analysis shows no covariance with Ks, suggesting that to eliminate methyl-associated effects CpG rates themselves must be analyzed. These results suggest that, in contrast to previous studies of intragenic variation, Ks patterns are not simply caused by the same forces responsible for Ka/Ks correlations.},
